# Ignoring artboards for the pretty diffs

* create a file called `.sketchignore` next to your sketch files
* put the name of the artboards inside (see [example](https://github.com/mathieudutour/git-sketch-plugin/blob/master/example/.sketchignore)).
It can either be the exact name of the artboard or a regex to match multiple artboards at once.
* profit
