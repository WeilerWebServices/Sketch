# Commandline

List of all the commandline arguments that can be passed to the plugin and what
they do. Includes ENV variables as well.



## Arguments

Here is the list of command line options you can pass to the `jekyll algolia` command:

| Flag                     | Description                                                           |
| ----                     | -----                                                                 |
| `--config ./_config.yml` | You can here specify the config file to use. Default is `_config.yml` |
| `--dry-run` or `-n`      | Do a dry run, do not actually push anything to your index             |
| `--verbose`              | Display more information about what is going to be indexed            |
| `--force-settings`       | Force update of the index settings                                    |


## Environment variables

The recommended place to store your Algolia application ID and index name are in
the `_config.yml` file but there are a few environment variables your can define
to overwrite those values.

key                    | value
---------------------- | ----------------------
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID | Your Application ID, available in [your dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys).
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME     | Your Index name, any string will work
ALGOLIA_API_KEY        | Your Admin API Key, available in [your dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys).

## `_algolia_api_key` file

The recommended way to define your Algolia admin API key is to use the
`ALGOLIA_API_KEY` environment variable. Because this key should be kept secret,
its better if it's loaded directly from the environment. But the plugin can also
load the key from another source.

You can create a file named `_algolia_api_key` in your source directory that
contains your admin API key. If no `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` environment variable is
defined, the plugin will fallback to the value set in the `_algolia_api_key`
file.

**Note that this method trades off security for convenience, so be very careful
when using it. Do not commit this file in your versioning system (add it to your
`.gitignore` for example).**
