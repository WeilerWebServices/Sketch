### Workflows

#### Conventional commits

Try and use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) convention when writing
commit messages.

#### Releases

This repo uses [Atlassian Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to automate the npm
release process. Read the docs for more information, but the top-level summary is:

- A GitHub Action maintains a permanently open PR that when merged will publish the package to npm
  with the latest changes and an automatically determined semver
- If the work you do in a PR should affect the next release, then you need to commit a "changeset"
  to the repo together with the rest of your code changes - do this by running `yarn changeset`.
  You'll be asked to provide a change type (major, minor or patch) and a message
