title: "Test post again"

The goal of this post is simply to trigger pagination, and see that we do not
index the pagination results.

Note that we added `categories` and `tags` in the front-matter but those won't
be taken into account. Might be a Jekyll bug/feature, but tags and categories
for regular collection items are always empty. Posts work correctly, though.
