# Developer website

The build process in this folder generates the developer website for [Sketch](http://sketch.com), that is hosted on Netlify at [developer.sketch.com](https://developer.sketch.com).

Alternatively, the website content is contained in the sibling [`docs`](../docs) folder.

## Contribute!

We've made this public so you can contribute to it. If you find a typo, or an error, or want to improve the content, feel free to send us a pull request. Also, if there's anything you'd like to see covered or documented, file an issue and we'll do it for you.

In order to make a change open a PR branching off `develop`. You should see a Netlify deploy preview appear in the PR, which is a convenient way to see how your changes will impact the live site.

It may take some time to see your changes live on [developer.sketch.com](https://developer.sketch.com), since production deployments only happen alongside Sketch releases.

> We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as our content backend, so make sure to read their docs if you need help understanding how the system works.

## Starting a local dev server

If you want to get the site working locally to preview your changes, you'll need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [bundler](http://bundler.io) installed. On OS X you'll also need to have Xcode's command-line tools installed (`xcode-select --install`).

Once you have them, to start a local dev server invoke the `run` script in this folder,

```
./run
```

The `run` script will take care of installing all the needed dependencies if they’re not installed, so it may take a while if it’s the first time you’re running it.

Once the dev server is running, making changes to website content in the sibling [`docs`](../docs) folder should trigger a live reload.

> Note: you may find issues with nokogiri when running `run`. If that's the case, try the following:
>
> ```sh
> bundle config build.nokogiri \
>   --use-system-libraries \
>   --with-xml2-include=/usr/include/libxml2/
> ```
>
> If that doesn't work, check the troubleshooting tips on [Nokogiri's page](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#mac_os_x)

## Generated sections

As well as the normal Jekyll processing, there are some areas of the site where the source files are themselves generated by other tools. In particular:

- The API documentation that is stored in [`docs/api`](../docs/api)
- The reference file pages that is stored in [`docs/pages`](..docs/pages)

Therefore take care not to waste time hand-editing this generated content, as it will just get replaced next time the scripts are run. Instead, file pull-requests to change the things that the scripts generate the content _from_ - eg the SketchAPI repo or the repos for the example plugins (all of which are open-source).
