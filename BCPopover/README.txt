BCPopover
=========

NSPopover substitute which in vertical mode allows for more control over placement. In vertical mode the popover is placed centered above the parent view of the view you're attaching it to. This allows you to show a popover but force it to stay clear of other elements in your UI you don't want to obstruct.
